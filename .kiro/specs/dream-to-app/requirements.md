# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Dream-to-App is a personalized goal achievement platform that transforms any user's dream or goal into a custom interactive application. Users input their goals in natural language, and the system generates a tailored app with milestone tracking, progress visualization, and motivational features. This addresses the common problem of people setting ambitious goals but lacking structured, personalized tools to achieve them.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a goal-setter, I want to input my dream in natural language, so that I can get a personalized app without having to design it myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a goal description in plain English THEN the system SHALL parse the input and extract key components (timeline, goal type, measurable outcomes)
2. WHEN the system processes a goal THEN it SHALL generate a structured plan with milestones and tracking metrics
3. IF the goal description is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL prompt for clarification on timeline or specific targets
4. WHEN goal parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the generated app structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with a fitness goal, I want an automatically generated training plan with progress tracking, so that I can stay on track without manual planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs a fitness-related goal THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate milestones (weekly targets, training phases)
2. WHEN the fitness app is created THEN it SHALL include progress tracking fields relevant to the goal type (distance, time, repetitions)
3. WHEN a user logs progress THEN the system SHALL update visual progress indicators and calculate completion percentages
4. IF a user falls behind schedule THEN the system SHALL suggest plan adjustments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a learning-focused user, I want a study plan with knowledge tracking, so that I can systematically progress toward my learning goal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs a learning goal THEN the system SHALL break it into study milestones and knowledge checkpoints
2. WHEN the learning app is generated THEN it SHALL include appropriate tracking metrics (vocabulary learned, chapters completed, practice hours)
3. WHEN a user completes study sessions THEN the system SHALL update knowledge progress and suggest next steps
4. WHEN milestones are reached THEN the system SHALL provide positive reinforcement and unlock new content areas

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a creative project pursuer, I want milestone tracking for long-term projects, so that I can maintain momentum on complex creative goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs a creative goal THEN the system SHALL generate project phases and deliverable milestones
2. WHEN the creative app is created THEN it SHALL include progress tracking for measurable outputs (words written, chapters completed, artworks finished)
3. WHEN a user logs creative work THEN the system SHALL visualize progress toward the final goal
4. IF progress stalls THEN the system SHALL provide inspiration prompts and motivation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As any goal-setter, I want motivational features and gamification, so that I stay engaged and motivated throughout my journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes progress THEN the system SHALL provide positive reinforcement messages
2. WHEN consistent progress is made THEN the system SHALL track and display streak counters
3. WHEN milestones are achieved THEN the system SHALL celebrate with visual feedback and achievement badges
4. WHEN a user opens their app THEN the system SHALL display encouraging messages and progress highlights

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who wants to refine my approach, I want to customize my generated app, so that it better fits my specific needs and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their generated app THEN they SHALL be able to modify timeline, milestones, and tracking metrics
2. WHEN customizations are made THEN the system SHALL regenerate the app with updated specifications
3. WHEN a user requests style changes THEN the system SHALL update the visual appearance accordingly
4. IF customizations conflict with the goal structure THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user tracking multiple goals, I want to manage different dream apps, so that I can pursue various objectives simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has multiple goals THEN the system SHALL maintain separate apps for each goal
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the user SHALL see an overview of all active dream apps
3. WHEN switching between apps THEN the system SHALL maintain individual progress and settings
4. WHEN goals are completed THEN the system SHALL archive the app while preserving achievement history

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer integrating this system, I want a clean API for dream-to-app generation, so that the functionality can be embedded in other platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request is made with a goal description THEN the system SHALL return a structured app specification
2. WHEN the API generates an app spec THEN it SHALL include all necessary components (milestones, UI elements, tracking fields)
3. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the API SHALL return clear error messages and suggested corrections
4. WHEN the API is called THEN it SHALL respond within acceptable time limits for real-time generation
